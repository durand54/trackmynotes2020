## About Track My Notes

Track  My Notes started off as an application to help sort out the data that had been pulled down from sources for use in tracking clients who may want to  commit to booking rooms or convention space. After use and many discussions we thought the application could actually be used in many different business, in keeping track of contacts, notes, and a hot list of those clients that were ready to move forward. This product will allow for the tracking before the user adds the client into their workflow, whether on a corporate level or on an individual level, small business or  sales person trying to keep track of their daily interaction with their leads.
